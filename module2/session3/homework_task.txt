Our food order management system database can now handle items data. 
But the client also needs to record customer orders. They want the customer name and phone (unique)
to be recorded along with their purchases. So when they make an order, we can see who make the order, 
how much is the total price paid for one order, and the order date. 
They also want the order details recorded, which items are bought in one order and how many 
(quantity of each item bought).

1) Define the additional entities and design the entity relationship diagram
2) Create tables that represent the entities
3) Insert minimal 5 dummy records for each entity
4) Display data which contains all orders information, with their respective customer name and phone information
